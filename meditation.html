                    <h4> Improved cardiac health</h4>
                    <p> Meditation is known to lower blood pressure by easing stress and reducing strain on the heart.
                        Countless studies have shown that regular meditation can slightly lower blood pressure or reduce
                        the need for blood pressure medications. By lowering blood pressure, you also reduce the risk of
                        a heart attack and stroke.</p>

                    <h4> Greater Sense of Self-Awareness</h4>
                    <p>Meditation allows us to mentally take inventory of our bodies. Much like the physical practice of yoga, meditation helps you establish a stronger connection
                        between mind and body. Through this greater sense of self-awareness, we cultivate present moment
                        awareness which allows us to remain present, grounded, and focused in all aspects and every
                        moment of our lives.</p>

                <div class="m-col">
                    <h4> Reduce Stress and Anxiety</h4>
                    <p>Obsessing about the past or future can often lead to unhappiness. We can only control what is
                        happening now which is why there is no reason to be caught up in the past or fixate on the future.
                        Our life is always in the now. Meditation is the anchor to help you stay there. This is the key
                        to reducing stress, gaining control over your anxiety, and ultimately living a more stress-free
                        and happy life.</p>

                <div class="m-col">
                    <h4> Increase Mental Clarity and Focus</h4>
                    <p>If we are mindful and focused on the present moment, we are fully engaged in present action.
                        Think of how amazing all your work would be if you were completely focused on it, and not caught
                        up in the chatter of your mind, or impulsively checking your cell phone or social media every
                        five minutes. Meditation helps us unplug and tune in to what is going on beneath the surface of
                        our thoughts. Over time, this becomes a subconscious habit that results in increased mental clarity and focus,
                        and your memory and mental acuity will improve too.</p>

                <div class="m-col">
                    <h4> Emotional Intelligence</h4>
                    <p>When we have time to sit without any distractions, we are able to get more in touch with our
                        emotions. We may realize the root cause of our unrest or worry. Regular meditation helps us
                        recognize our emotions as fleeting, but also allows us the chance to sit with them instead of
                        avoiding or being afraid of facing our emotions. As a result, you deepen your emotional
                        intelligence and ability to recognize and work through emotional issues as they arise, which
                        impacts your relationships and mind state in a positive way.</p>

                <div class="m-col">
                    <h4> Retrain your brain</h4>
                    <p>One of the supreme benefits of meditation is that it holds the power to retrain your
                        brain. Yes, your brain is trainable. As the brain is used, it tends to grow. Meditation can help
                        the brain learn to manage its own system. Consider it as car-servicing. Meditation redirects our
                        minds back to think more calmly and clearly focus when presented with a
                        stressor when we are not meditating, rather than letting our impulsive impulses drive us.</p>
